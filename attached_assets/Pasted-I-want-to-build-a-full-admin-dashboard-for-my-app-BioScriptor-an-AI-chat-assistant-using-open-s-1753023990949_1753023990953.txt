I want to build a full admin dashboard for my app **BioScriptor** (an AI chat assistant using open-source APIs like GROQ, Together, OpenRouter, Cohere). The app uses Firebase Auth and Firestore.

---

🎯 Goal: Allow only authorized admins to manage users, subscription plans, usage stats, payment issues, and model routing.

---

🔐 Admin Login:
- Only allow access to users with `user.role === "admin"` from Firestore
- Redirect unauthorized users away
- Admin login page (or bypass if already logged in as admin)

---

📊 Dashboard Sections (Tabs or Sidebar Menu):

1. 🧑‍💻 **User Management**
   - View all users (email, plan, usage stats)
   - Search, filter by plan (Free, Pro, Team)
   - Reset usage limits
   - Ban, suspend, or upgrade users
   - Add credits manually
   - View chat history count

2. 💰 **Plan Management**
   - Create/Edit pricing plans
   - Set features for each tier (message limits, models, export access)
   - Adjust pricing or offer promo codes

3. 🔑 **API Keys & Model Routing**
   - Add/remove model APIs (GROQ, Together, etc.)
   - Set model priority based on plan level
   - Toggle which APIs are active
   - View error logs or failed API calls

4. 📈 **Analytics**
   - Total users
   - Daily active users
   - Message volume
   - Revenue from subscriptions
   - Most used models

5. 🧾 **Payments & Subscriptions**
   - View current active subscriptions
   - Handle failed payments
   - Trigger manual upgrade/downgrade
   - Add lifetime access

6. 🛠️ **Settings**
   - Toggle features globally (e.g., dark mode, watermark, beta features)
   - Announcements or changelog messages to users
