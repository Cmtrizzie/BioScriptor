 Coding Assistant Bot that has 5 Core Skills:

Code (Syntax, Logic, Debugging)

Development (APIs, Frameworks, Full-stack tasks)

Software Practices (Git, Testing, CI/CD, Clean Code)

System Design (Architecture, Scaling, Databases)

Advanced Technical Knowledge (Security, Optimization, Cloud, AI, etc.)

You want to:
Use these skills as Functional Modules in the chatbot.

Let the chatbot assist, guide, and solve tasks in each category.

Progressively unlock deeper-level assistance as the user advances.

üéØ Here‚Äôs the Logic Architecture for Your Coding Assistant
1. Skill Modules (Assistant Capabilities):
Each of these is a Skill Module in your bot logic:

Module Name	Scope of Assistance
Coding Module	Syntax corrections, logic building, debugging walkthroughs, algorithms help.
Development Module	API integrations, frontend/backend help, code snippets for frameworks (React, Node, Django, etc.).
Software Practices Module	Git commands, CI/CD pipeline setup, testing strategies, code review practices.
System Design Module	Architecture diagrams, scaling strategies, design patterns, database schema design.
Advanced Technical Module	Security best practices, performance tuning, cloud architecture (AWS/GCP), AI/ML code.

2. User Command Structure (Skill Invocation Logic):
User Request Example	Bot Logic Response
‚ÄúHelp me debug this Python code.‚Äù	Trigger ‚Üí Coding Module
‚ÄúHow to connect React frontend to a Node.js backend?‚Äù	Trigger ‚Üí Development Module
‚ÄúExplain how Git branching works.‚Äù	Trigger ‚Üí Software Practices Module
‚ÄúDesign a scalable e-commerce system.‚Äù	Trigger ‚Üí System Design Module
‚ÄúHow do I secure a REST API with JWT?‚Äù	Trigger ‚Üí Advanced Technical Module

3. Modular Prompt Template (Dynamic Prompting per Skill)

Edit
{
  "SkillModule": "System Design",
  "SystemPrompt": "You are a System Design Expert. Provide architecture diagrams, trade-offs, and scaling strategies.",
  "UserInput": "{user's query}",
  "ResponseFormat": "Step-by-step explanation with code or diagram suggestions if applicable."
}
You can switch the SkillModule dynamically based on user‚Äôs question intent.

4. Skill Progression Logic (Optional but Powerful)
You can optionally add skill levels:

Beginner (Simple Q&A)

Intermediate (Guided Code Walkthroughs)

Advanced (Complex Problem Solving)

As users interact more, the bot can start giving less hand-holding and more high-level guidance, simulating real-life engineering growth.
